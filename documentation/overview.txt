Infoshopkeeper2 is a rewrite of the original infoshopkeeper, written by John Duda
for Red Emma's, an infoshop in Baltimore.

The original infoshopkeeper can be found at the following URL: https://github.com/johm/infoshopkeeper

Infoshopkeeper2 (ISK2) is a rewrite by Markos Kapes. The original Infoshopkeeper database was retained, but 
the user interface was rewritten in Python 3. 

ISK2 uses the following technology stack:
    - CherryPy - a minimalist Python framework (http://cherrypy.org/)
    - Cheetah3, a python-powered templating engine (http://cheetahtemplate.org/)
    - sqlobject python 3 library for object relational mapping
    - simplejson python 3 library
    - isbnlib python 3 library
    - tools python 3 library
    - requests python 3 library
    - pyAesCrypt python 3 library
    - reportlab python 3 library
    - the mysql database engine
    - the apache2 http server

ISK2 was designed to run on Ubuntu 16.04 and requires the following packages to be installed:
    - python3
    - python3-pip 
    - mysql-server 
    - python3-mysqldb 
    - python3-dev 
    - libxml2-dev 
    - libxslt1-dev 

For reliable access to the ISK2 from a remote location, the Wooden Shoe has been using a DNS from 
noip.com: woodenshoebooks.ddns.net. This DNS will expire after a period of time unless the host 
name is confirmed periodically. Currently, Tom Magee confirms it when he receives an email from
no-ip.com.

Tom Magee setup a service on the shoe's main computer called noip2. The service can be downloaded
from no-ips website if we ever need to set it up again.

THE APACHE WEB SERVER
---------------------

ISK2 is designed to run on a local computer, however since it is run as a web 
app the admin obviously can setup remote access as well.

At the Wooden Shoe,  
Ideally, three sites configuration files are setup in apache2's sites-enabled directory:
   - localhost.conf - for local access to ISK2
      - The localhost.conf apache config file on the main server only allows access to the 127.0.0.1 
        URL. For the vagrant setup, you have to update localhost.conf to be accessible from the 
        vagrant host (usually 10.0.2.2)
   - woodenshoebooks.ddns.net-ssl.conf - for remote access


The app uses the python sqlobject library to connect to each table as an object. Look in the "objects" 
folder for all of the database classes that the app uses to access the database
